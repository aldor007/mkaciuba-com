On April 19, 2018, along with a friend, I had the pleasure to lead workshops introducing the participants to GoLang.

The workshops were organized by [DreamLab](https://www.dreamlab.pl). For the first time, I had the opportunity to conduct such presentations and workshops. I must admit that it was a very nice experience. Sharing knowledge for such a group of participants was very nice. I think that I will have to try similar projects someday. Below are materials from the workshops.
