It's been over 4 years from my [post](/blog/posts/mort-release) about [mort](https://github.com/aldor007/mort) and I'm still using it :).
Today I want to discuss what has changed in mort and some let's say interesting bugs that I've found


# Improvement in mort 0.21.2

## tengo scripts

This is the biggest feature that I've added to mort. It allows users to write their own URL decoder without rebuilding of mort. For scripting language, I've used [tengo](https://github.com/d5/tengo)

Let's see an example

```yaml
# https://github.com/aldor007/mort/blob/master/configuration/config.yml
buckets:
    tengo:
        keys:
          - accessKey: "acc"
            secretAccessKey: "sec"
        transform:
            kind: "tengo" # new transform kind
            tengoPath: 'parse.tengo' # path to tengo script
        storages:
            basic:
                kind: "http"
                url: "https://i.imgur.com/<item>"
                headers:
                  "x--key": "sec"
            transform:
                kind: "local-meta"
                rootPath: "/tmp/mort/"
                pathPrefix: "transforms"
```

Mort will read `parse.tengo` file and execute it on each request for bucket `tengo`.

Content of `parse.tengo` file:

```go
fmt := import("fmt")
text := import("text")

parse := func(reqUrl, bucketConfigF, obj) {
     // split by "." to remove object extension
    elements := text.split_n(reqUrl.path, ".", 2)
    ext := elements[1]
    if len(elements) == 1 {
        return ""
    }
    // split by "," to find resize parameters
    elements = text.split(elements[0], ",")

    // url has no transform
    if len(elements) == 1 {
        return ""
    }

    // apply parameters
    width := 0
    height := 0
    parent := elements[0] +"." +  ext
    trans := elements[1:]
    for tran in trans {
        if tran[0] == 'w' {
            width = tran[1:]
        }

        if tran[0] == 'h' {
            height = tran[1:]
        }
    }

    obj.transforms.resize(int(width), int(height), false, false, false)
    return parent
}

parent := parse(url, bucketConfig, obj)
```

Above script will work for URL http://localhost:8084/tengo/udXmD2T,w100,h100.jpeg

More info on how to write your own parse can be found in [doc](https://github.com/aldor007/mort/blob/master/doc/TengoUrlParser.md)

## Redis lock

From now on mort can use a redis server for indicating the generation of the image. Mort instance which will win race for the lock will notify others when a process has ended, so they can read image from cache or storage. Lock has a similar configuration as redis cache. Example:

```yaml
server:
  lock:
      type: "redis"
      address:
        - "localhost:6379"
      clientConfig:
```

Implementation details can be found [here](https://github.com/aldor007/mort/blob/master/pkg/lock/redis.go)

## access logs

Small feature but useful for debugging. To enable

```yaml
server:
    accessLogs: true

```

## support for more storages

Mort now supports
* B2
* Azure
* Oracle
* Google
* and even sftp storage

More about it [here](https://github.com/aldor007/mort/blob/master/doc/Configuration.md#storage)

## CI/CD improvements

For CI instead of travis-ci I'm now using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
Changes:
* tests executed on each PR and after the merge to master (unit and integrations)
* mort uses now conventional commits and semantic release for tagging of versions
* goreleaser for GitHub release with binary
* auto-deploy to my homelab after docker build

# Interesting bugs

During development, I've discovered some unintended behaviors of mort.

## Issue with serving big files

### processTimeout

Processing timeout was applied for all requests not only image creation so if mort was streaming response it has to be completed before the end of `processTimeout`

| *processTimeout fix* |

### http.Server timeout

Timeout for http.Server is for whole response so if mort is proxying huge file it has now 2h to end it

# Idea what to do next

* support for distributed tracing
* redirect to source storage (so mort will not proxy big files)
